# Algorithms

This repository was created in a TTY Linux only environment using Github CLI. I will be documenting my progress.

-- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.
-- Run time of an algorithm is measured in Big O notation.
-- O(log n) is fater than O(n). Especially when the items you are searching grows
