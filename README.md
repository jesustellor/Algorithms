# Algorithms

This repository was created in a TTY Linux only environment using Github CLI. I will be documenting my progress.

## Big O notation

-- O(log n), also known as log time, example Biary Search
-- O(n), also known as linear time, example Simple Search
-- O(n * log n), A fast sorting algorithm, like Quicksort
-- O(n^2), A slow sorting algorithm, like Selection Sort
-- O(n!), A really slow algorithm, like traveling salesman

-- Algorithm speed isn't measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.
-- Run time of an algorithm is measured in Big O notation.
-- O(log n) is fater than O(n). Especially when the items you are searching grows
